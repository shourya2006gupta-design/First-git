        Shambhavi... My cute little sister , not so little but young - young . Never called bhaiya even though I am big . But don't underestimate her or judge her , she is 2 years younger than me but we are in same pace , studied the same class together. She was the one who always gets more marks than me , even after i have age advantage.  Either, I am too dumb or she is extraordinary . You have guessed it right , but I don't wanna say it .And .. and.. She is the most loved cousin of all because she is in hostel from class - 5 and till now she is in hostel preparing for neet . So you know na, demand and supply system , it's rare to meet her so her demand in our family is high .if I have to tell about us , I got more close to her after 10th when she decided to go to dummy school and start preparing for neet . As she got her personal phone there.  So, the eternal story of cousinship begins from here....
      </p>
      <p>
        She is not fond of big paragraphs , and let's not speak up much  in public platform . But .. But ... But thankyou thankyou to be the only cousin , nah ! nah !! this is not the perfect term , perfect term is only relative in my whole family to not only be my friend but only the one who I trust the most . Yes , we both are immature, we need to learn more about our lifes , grow more , take more mature decision and be out of same sort of problems in which we fall again and again. Purpose of saying this is you are not alone , we 2 newbies will together go in adventure and reach our destiny. Always with you to listen , support, help you with everything.... </p>
